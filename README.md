#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.
 

### What I did

Dom structure was modified slightly to improve accessibility.  Aria attributes were added where appropriate.  CSS was modified to make the site more accessible.  A service worker caches the site resources to serve it up when offline.
